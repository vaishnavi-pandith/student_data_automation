# 📊 Student Data Automation & Ranking System (Python)

A Python-based automation tool designed to clean, sort, rank, and export student data collected from Google Forms (Excel/CSV).  
Built using a **modular, production-style architecture** to handle real-world messy data reliably.

---

## 🚀 Why this project?

Manual processing of student data (marks, CGPA, rankings) from Excel sheets is:
- Error-prone  
- Time-consuming  
- Hard to standardize  

This project automates the entire workflow — from raw form responses to ranked, export-ready results — using clean, reusable Python modules.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📥 Supports **CSV & Excel** input files  
- 🧹 Data cleaning pipeline:
  - Column normalization
  - Empty row removal
  - Safe numeric conversion  
- 🔀 **Multi-column sorting** (e.g., CGPA → Name → USN)  
- 🏆 **Top-N ranking** using dense ranking  
- 🔍 Optional filtering by column values  
- 📤 Export results to **Excel & CSV**  
- 💻 Interactive **CLI-based workflow**
